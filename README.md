vim_wok_visualcpp
=================

I've been using this plugin for so long I struggle without it. I couldn't find
it anywhere on github, so I'm hosting it here so I can install it as a git
submodule.

Description
------------

Some MS Visual Studio C++ like behavior for VIM
MS & Visual Studio, Visual C++ (TM) by Microsoft Corp.

<Home>                  toggles cursor pos between first-column and first-non-whitespace-column
<TAB>                   indents current selected lines by one shiftwidth
<Shift>+<TAB>           un-indents current selected lines by one shiftwidth
<CTRL><F2>              Toggles an anonymous 'mark' on/off for the current line (uses named marks a-z)
